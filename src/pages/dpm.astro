Users of Deltapath Mobile are able to adapt to any situation at any time and place while keeping high fidelity, excellent audio quality, instant messaging, access to conference calls on the fly, and much more.",

const problemItems = [
  "Other apps often have one primary feature that serves as the focal point of the app.",
  "When fewer features are available, other businesses usually create separate apps rather than merging all features into one.",
  "Typically, all of the functionality can be arranged on the bottom screen's tabs."
];

const deltpathRequirementsItems = [
  "Each user relies on different key features, so the app needs to ensure that everyone enjoys using their specific features.",
  "The UI must group additional features so that the interface is not cluttered or overwhelming.",
  "Not all functionality can fit on the bottom screen tabs."
];

const solutionItems = [
  "During installation, users can select features to have shortcuts on their home screens, making it easier to access their primary tasks.",
  "The home screen should be simple to avoid information overload.",
  "A side menu will provide access to other features. While many apps use a bottom tab, Deltapath's complex structure benefits from a side menu for better user experience.",
  "Upon restarting the app after closing it, the user will return to the home screen.",
  "If users exit without terminating the app, it will reopen to the last page or activity."
