## About me

### Hi there!

Iâ€™m Felicia, a creative software engineer.

I love building web applications that blend cutting-edge technology with a seamless user experience, I have worked primarily with React, Node.js, SQL, Next.js, TypeScript, GraphQL, TypeORM, tRPC and Prisma.

I stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and best practices through continuous learning, and attending webinars, conferences, and workshops.

During my leisure time, I enjoy drawing, immersing myself in comics, or exploring the outdoors through hiking.

Are you all set to work on some thrilling projects with me? Let's collaborate and create something fun!
