  desc2: `If you are like me, meal planning can be a challenge, especially when you have limited ingredients on hand or dietary restrictions to consider.
           What to Eat takes the guesswork out of meal planning and helps you find delicious recipes that fit your unique preferences and needs.`,

const limitations = `
  If there is a typo in the ingredients form, the result will not show properly, so the user has to be very precise when inputting their items.
  Sometimes Spoonacular API includes items that are not part of the user's dietary requirements.

const futureEnhancements = `
  In the future, I am planning to include NLP in the ingredients form, so when a user types something that is not precise, the NLP can predict what the user means and fix those inputs.
  Another future enhancement will be adding meal planning capabilities and the ability to add favorite meals.
