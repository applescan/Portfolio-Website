    "In today’s modern era, music is readily available online. You can play whatever you want whenever you want it. In the 90s, before platforms like Spotify were invented, music enthusiasts had to make their way to a record store or a CD store. There’s a sense of nostalgia with heading to a store and flicking through rows of CDs. Driven by post-pandemic angst, retro entertainment options are coming back on trend.",
    "Mixtape-me aims to recreate that experience of walking through the doors of a record store looking at CD covers and store walls with colourful albums, memorabilia, and photos, transferring the same experience into digital form. With Spotify's technology, it's easier than ever to find out who you listen to most all year long, in the last 6 months, or even right now."
