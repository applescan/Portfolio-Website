> The **NZ Veterinary Locum Network** was created to solve a real communication gap in the veterinary industry.
> Locums in NZ had no proper way to showcase their profiles — and clinics had no central platform to find available locums.
> This project creates that missing link and gives both sides the ability to connect freely and directly.

## 💡 Why Is This Project Important?

There was **no platform** tailored for veterinary locums in NZ to promote themselves outside of recruitment agencies.
New locums who lack clinic connections find it nearly impossible to discover job opportunities.

The **only option** before was a cluttered Facebook group.
This app changes that — offering clinics a searchable, organized way to find and message locums directly.

## 🐛 Known Limitation

> ❗ If you upload an image over **1MB**, it may fail due to outdated TLS policies on the cloud server.
> Modern browsers block these uploads due to CORS errors.

You can read more about it [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/create-tls-listener.html).

> ✅ If you run the backend **locally**, this issue should not occur.

## 🔮 Future Enhancement

I plan to add **automatic expiration for job listings**.
Once the due date has passed, listings will be hidden or deleted automatically — helping keep the platform clean and up to date.
